# Heart Disease Classification with Random Forest

![](https://github.com/tenzinmigmar/heart-disease-classification/blob/main/banner.png)

## Overview
This project examines a dataset focusing on 14 features relevant to predicting heart disease in patients. We first walk through the dataset using exploratory data analysis and data visualization to gain a better understanding of the data we are working with. Next, a heart disease classifier is trained on the data using Random Forests, a popular machine learning model, which achieves a maximum accuracy of 88.5% after searching for the optimal number of trees to use.
